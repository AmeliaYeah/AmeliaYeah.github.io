## The RCE from Heap Exploitation problem

So, one time before I was doing a CTF. It was your standard binary exploitation challenge on the heap, nothing too out of the ordinary. I was performing the standard techniques (exploiting UAF, getting a write-what-where by making malloc return arbitrary addresses, etc.)

The binary, for context, had all the protections.
1. Full RELRO (Could not perform a GOT overwrite)
1. NX (Couldn't execute custom shellcode)
1. Stack Canary (Not like this matters; we're exploiting on the heap)
1. PIE (Self-explanatory)

Except..that's when I stumbled upon a problem. You see, back in the day, there would be these things called "hooks"; special portions of the binary that, whenever some function like malloc() or free() was ran, it would execute the addresses in those hooks and thus grant some form of RCE.

And that was great and all, basically being the standard for this sort of thing. [Until they got removed in LibC 2.34](https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/08/25/securing-malloc-glibc-why-malloc-hooks-had-go).

This problem ended up stumping me for quite some time because, what other alternative was there? If we're on the heap, we can pretty much only (reliably) get a leak from LibC itself but nothing else. How are we supposed to leverage *only* reliable access to the LibC address space and gain RCE? Is that even possible?

## \_\_exit\_funcs

During my research, I ended up using two sources that would ultimately help me better understand this topic. [This CTF Writeup](https://ctftime.org/writeup/34804) along with the [seperate document/article](https://binholic.blogspot.com/2017/05/notes-on-abusing-exit-handlers.html) they referenced. You are more than free to access these if you wish, but I'll go ahead and summarize them in a more easy to understand and simplified manner.

It may also help to look at [exit.h](https://elixir.bootlin.com/glibc/glibc-2.41/source/stdlib/exit.h) and [exit.c](https://elixir.bootlin.com/glibc/glibc-2.41/source/stdlib/exit.c) from the LibC source code. LibC 2.41 is used here, but the concept should make sense for most other versions >= 2.41

```c {script_name="exit.h"}
struct exit_function
{
  /* `flavour' should be of type of the `enum' above but since we need
     this element in an atomic operation we have to use `long int'.  */
  long int flavor;
  union
    {
void (*at) (void);
struct
  {
    void (*fn) (int status, void *arg);
    void *arg;
  } on;
struct
  {
    void (*fn) (void *arg, int status);
    void *arg;
    void *dso_handle;
  } cxa;
    } func;
};

struct exit_function_list
{
  struct exit_function_list *next;
  size_t idx;
  struct exit_function fns[32];
};

extern struct exit_function_list *__exit_funcs attribute_hidden;
```

As seen from above, `__exit_funcs` is just a pointer to an `exit_function_list` struct. The struct being pointed to, as per the type, is a singly linked list, storing at most 32 `exit_function` structs within each entry.

Looking at the source code for `exit()`, the function is literally just a wrapper to `__run_exit_handlers()`, just automatically filling in all the internal data for us.

```c {script_name="exit.c"}
void exit (int status)
{
  __run_exit_handlers (status, &__exit_funcs, true, true);
}
libc_hidden_def (exit)
```

The `__run_exit_handlers` function executed here, for the sake of brevity, interprets each `exit_function`, and ultimately executes it in multiple different ways according to the `flavor` enum/int value. This, essentially, is just intentional code execution.

Seems great right? Here's an example of what can be done:
1. Generate some `exit_function_list` node (call it `A`), with it containing an `exit_function` of our choosing.
	* Recommended to use the `ef_cxa` (4) enum value for `flavor`, as the actual function to execute is interpreted as `func(void* ptr, int status)`. This makes it possible to do `system("/bin/sh")` due to the first value being treated as a pointer, and system only takes one parameter anyway.
1. Somehow write to `__exit_funcs` and have it point to our malicious node, thus executing our code.
1. Pwned

But, enough with the theoretical side of things; let's get to the practicalities.

## Day in the Life of an Exit Function

Sparing the extra details of heap exploitation and whatnot, let's make a simple program just to be a wrapper for this behavior.

```c {script_name="example.c"}
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

//compatibility with pwntools
void setup() {
	setbuf(stdin, NULL);
	setbuf(stdout, NULL);
}

int main() {
	setup();

	printf("popen: %p\n", popen);
	while(1) {
		printf("What would you like to do? ");

		char* addr;
		scanf("%p", &addr);
		getchar();

		//exit
		if(addr == (char*)1) {
			exit(0);
			break;
		}

		//allocate memory
		if(addr == (char*)2) {
			char* ptr = malloc(100);
			fgets(ptr, 100, stdin);
			printf("%p\n", ptr);
			continue;
		}

		//read or write
		if(getchar() == 'r') {
			printf("READ: %lx\n", *(long*)addr);
		}else {
			scanf("%8s", (char*)addr);
		}
	}
}
```

It's essentially a proof of concept that simplifies all the prerequisites that will be simplified when utilizing this tactic (you have reliable LibC and heap access but nothing else, and the binary is fully protected).

You run it, it gives you a LibC leak, and lets you write to any address you choose by default. Specifying '1' exits, specifying '2' lets you write to some allocated portion on the heap. We have an ability to read/write the address. Simple enough.

Running it in GDB, we can go ahead and print out the actual exit function list. We get the following output (since, by default, there's only 1 exit function that actually gets handled (`_dl_fini`))

```as
pwndbg> x/8xg __exit_funcs
0x7ffff7f98fc0 <initial>:       0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000001
0x7ffff7f98fd0 <initial+16>:    0x0000000000000004      0xab808ec58cc15c1d
0x7ffff7f98fe0 <initial+32>:    0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000000
0x7ffff7f98ff0 <initial+48>:    0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000000
```

We can see that the actual struct is located at an exported symbol named `initial`.
1. The first 8 bytes, `NULL` in this case, is the "next" pointer in the linked list. Since this is the first and only node, there is nothing to go to, so it's empty.
1. The second 8 bytes is the `size_t` corresponding to the `idx` (index) of this current node. It is `0x1`, AKA, the first node in the list.
1. The later values after this are all just pointers to `exit_function` structures.

However, something's odd here. One of the exit functions in this list doesn't seem like a valid function address. Why?

### Pointer Guard

That's because of one thing I didn't mention yet: Pointer Mangling! (You thought this was gonna be easy?)

Look at `exit.c` again and how it handles function addresses. More specifically, this line for handling `ef_cxa` (though it's present in all other flavors that use addresses):

```c {script_name="exit.c"}
f->flavor = ef_free;
cxafct = f->func.cxa.fn;
arg = f->func.cxa.arg;
PTR_DEMANGLE (cxafct);
```

We see it's calling `PTR_DEMANGLE` on the actual function address. Since this binary is running on `x86_64` linux, we can view the [pointer_guard.h](https://elixir.bootlin.com/glibc/glibc-2.41/source/sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/x86_64/pointer_guard.h#L31) file that defines this macro, and see the following:

```c {script_name="pointer_guard.h"}
#define PTR_MANGLE(reg)
		xor __pointer_chk_guard_local(%rip), reg
		rol $2*LP_SIZE+1, reg
#define PTR_DEMANGLE(reg)
		ror $2*LP_SIZE+1, reg;
		xor __pointer_chk_guard_local(%rip), reg
```

And knowing it's 64 bit, we can look at [x86lp_size.h](https://elixir.bootlin.com/glibc/glibc-2.41/source/sysdeps/x86_64/x86-lp_size.h#L22) to identify the `LP_SIZE` parameter: `8`.

Knowing `rol` and `ror` are just bitshift operations, to demangle a pointer, it simply bitshifts it right 17 (8\*2 + 1) times, then XORs it by a randomly-generated-on-runtime XOR key `__pointer_chk_guard_local(%rip)`. However, while this is an annoying protection, it shouldn't be difficult to reverse once we leak this encrypted address and obtain it's plaintext somehow.

As stated before, this function is `_dl_fini`, but unfortunately, it isn't an exported function. This means that we will need to manually calculate the offset ourselves instead of relying on the offset given to us by other exported common LibC functions.

After stepping through `__run_exit_handlers` until we get to the assembly instructions related to `PTR_DEMANGLE`, the following instruction tells us the plaintext address of `_dl_fini`:

```as
 	â–º 0x7ffff7dfca5a <__run_exit_handlers+314>    xor    rax, qword ptr fs:[0x30]        RAX => 0x7ffff7fcbe20 (_dl_fini) (0xae0ed5c04762c660 ^ 0xae0eaa3fb09e7840)
```

This is great! Now all we need to do is subtract the LibC base address from the plaintext and!---wait...uh oh.

```as
0x7ffff7db8000     0x7ffff7dbb000 rw-p     3000      0 [anon_7ffff7db8]
0x7ffff7dbb000     0x7ffff7de3000 r--p    28000      0 libc.so.6
0x7ffff7de3000     0x7ffff7f3d000 r-xp   15a000  28000 libc.so.6
0x7ffff7f3d000     0x7ffff7f93000 r--p    56000 182000 libc.so.6
0x7ffff7f93000     0x7ffff7f97000 r--p     4000 1d7000 libc.so.6
0x7ffff7f97000     0x7ffff7f99000 rw-p     2000 1db000 libc.so.6
0x7ffff7f99000     0x7ffff7fa6000 rw-p     d000      0 [anon_7ffff7f99]
```

```python
>>> 0x7ffff7fcbe20 > 0x7ffff7f99000
True
```

The address of `_dl_fini` is **outside** the address space of `libc.so.6`! This means a `libc.so.6` leak just isn't good enough, since the space between address spaces is randomized and thus unpredictable.

So, where does it belong to?

```as
0x7ffff7fc6000     0x7ffff7fc8000 r-xp     2000      0 [vdso]
0x7ffff7fc8000     0x7ffff7fc9000 r--p     1000      0 ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
0x7ffff7fc9000     0x7ffff7ff0000 r-xp    27000   1000 ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
0x7ffff7ff0000     0x7ffff7ffb000 r--p     b000  28000 ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
0x7ffff7ffb000     0x7ffff7ffd000 r--p     2000  33000 ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
0x7ffff7ffd000     0x7ffff7fff000 rw-p     2000  35000 ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
0x7ffffffde000     0x7ffffffff000 rw-p    21000      0 [stack]
```

```python
>>> 0x7ffff7fc8000 < 0x7ffff7fcbe20 < 0x7ffff7fff000
True
```

Unlike most times where a function we want can be easily obtained by merely a libc leak, it looks like `_dl_fini` is rather instead belonging to `ld.so`.

### Calculating \_dl\_fini from an ld.so base address leak

Now, this is rather unorthodox. Normally you're used to leaking out PIE addresses of the binary itself or LibC addresses. How in the world do we obtain an `ld.so` leak? Much less from LibC?

Well, the answer is rather simple. There's alot of links between LibC and `ld.so`, but one of the simpler things I found was an exported symbol `__nptl_rtld_global`:

```as
pwndbg> p __nptl_rtld_global
$2 = (struct rtld_global *) 0x7ffff7ffd000 <_rtld_global> 
```

`_rtld_global` is a [structure](https://elixir.bootlin.com/glibc/glibc-2.41/source/elf/rtld.c#L320) which exists in `ld.so`.

In LibC, `__nptl_rtld_global`, shown [here](https://elixir.bootlin.com/glibc/glibc-2.41/source/nptl/pthread_create.c#L64), links to this `_rtld_global` in `ld.so`, thus giving us an address in `ld.so`.

With our LibC leak, we can simply read from the `__nptl_rtld_global` pointer and get the address of `_rtld_global`, ultimately getting our `ld.so` leak.

I decided to use one of the entries within `_rtld_global`, not the table itself, but ultimately this is arbitrary; as long as it is within `ld.so` it will be just fine.

```as
pwndbg> x/4xg __nptl_rtld_global
0x7ffff7ffd000 <_rtld_global>:  0x00007ffff7ffe2e0      0x0000000000000004
0x7ffff7ffd010 <_rtld_global+16>:       0x00007ffff7ffe5d8      0x0000000000000000
```

More specifically, the first 8 bytes, `0x00007ffff7ffe2e0`, is what I decided to go through with.

## Creating our very own EF

Now that everything's in place to bypass protections, and overall our understanding of exit functions is adequate, let's go ahead and create our exit function.

We will do the following:
1. Get a LibC leak somehow
1. Leak out, from `__exit_funcs`, the ciphertext of `PTR_MANGLE` XOR `_dl_fini_address`. Call this `_dl_fini_enc`.
1. Leak out this address shown above from `__nptl_rtld_global`, lets call it `A`.
1. In GDB, calculate the consistent offset between some `A` and its corresponding `ld.so` base. Use this offset to get any `ld.so` from any arbitrary `A`.
	* `0x00007ffff7ffe2e0 - 0x7ffff7fc8000 = 0x362e0 = offset_A`
1. Perform the same as the above, this time with `_dl_fini` to get *its* consistent offset from the `ld.so` address space start.
	* `0x7ffff7fcbe20 - 0x7ffff7fc8000 = 0x3e20 = offset_dl_fini`
1. In the actual exploit, leak out some `A`.
1. Perform `A - offset_A` to get `ld_so_base_address`
1. Perform `ld_so_base_address + offset_dl_fini` to get the address of `_dl_fini` for that current binary.
1. Undo the shifting operations, and then, knowing `_dl_fini_enc` and `_dl_fini`, perform `_dl_fini_enc` XOR `_dl_fini` to get the pointer guard XOR key.
1. Modify `__exit_funcs` in any valid way such that it points to a malicious exit function we constructed.
	* Remember that, in our case, using flavor `ef_cxa` is best given the format `func(void* arg, int status)`, since we intend our RCE to be a nice and simple `system("/bin/sh")`.

Since we have access to the heap, our goal is to allocate an entire `exit_function_list` struct and replace the value of `__exit_funcs` to that instead. Let's understand what we actually need to create.

```c {script_name="exit.h"}
enum
{
  ef_free,	/* `ef_free' MUST be zero!  */
  ef_us,
  ef_on,
  ef_at,
  ef_cxa
};
struct exit_function_list
{
	struct exit_function_list *next;
	size_t idx;
	struct exit_function fns[32];
};
struct exit_function
{
	long int flavor;
	union
	{
		void (*at) (void);
		struct
	 	 {
	    	void (*fn) (int status, void *arg);
	    	void *arg;
	  	 } on;
		struct
	  	{
	    	void (*fn) (void *arg, int status);
	    	void *arg;
	    	void *dso_handle;
	  	} cxa;
	} func;
};
```

For our own `exit_function_list`, we will do the following values to satisfy the `exit_function_list` struct and our `system("/bin/sh")` exit function.
1. NULL (8 null bytes, given 64 bit binary) for the "next" ptr
1. 1 for the index
1. 4 for the flavor
1. Encrypted address of `system` for `fn`
1. "/bin/sh" string for `void* arg`
1. A bunch of null bytes; after `system("/bin/sh")` is called we don't care about binary corruption anyway so it doesn't really matter past the first 8.

We can simply allocate to the heap all those bytes, modify `__exit_funcs` to point to this newly allocated heap chunk, and then call `exit()` and have ourselves a brand new bash shell.

## Wrapping up

### Information

Incase you wanted to try this out, the only thing that really needs to match is the LibC and ld.so versions i'm using. The actual binary itself doesn't need to be identical since it's not involved in the exploit, so you can simply compile it yourself and use that.

The hashes of the libraries I used are:
* LibC version 2.40, sha1 `a03c98d0b534ed367baa0d4a4d4a94224b15a11a`
* ld.so version 2.40, sha1 `900bbb26d9de3755e363fa9f1024dae987361a8e`
